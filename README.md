# Ansible Playbook for System Update and Configuration

## Overview

This playbook is designed to automate the process of updating Debian/Ubuntu systems, checking for and performing necessary reboots, installing and configuring LDAP and SSSD for user authentication, and ensuring the correct configuration of related services and files. It aims to streamline system administration tasks, enhance security, and ensure consistent configurations across all managed nodes.

## Prerequisites

- Ansible 2.9 or higher installed on the control machine.
- Root access or equivalent permissions for the Ansible user on all target machines.
- Debian or Ubuntu-based target machines.
- SSH access configured for Ansible on all target machines.
- Required Ansible roles and collections installed (if any).

## How to Run

1. **Prepare Inventory File**: Ensure your Ansible inventory file is up to date with the target machines listed under the appropriate groups.

2. **Configure Variables**: Customize the variables in the playbook or in separate variable files (`vars/`, `group_vars/`, `host_vars/`) as needed. This includes LDAP configuration details, server URIs, and any specific package versions.

3. **Run the Playbook**:
   ```sh
   ansible-playbook -i path/to/inventory playbook.yml
